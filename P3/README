CS4411 Project 3 - Unreliable Datagram Networking

The progamming is done in the Linux/GCC environment. 

We implemented the network handler in minithread.c. We also implemented 
functions for unreliable datagram in minimsg.c.

For some of the test cases to compile without warning, we modified their source 
code.
