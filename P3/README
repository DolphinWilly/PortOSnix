CS4411 Project 3 - Unreliable Datagram Networking

The progamming is done in the Linux/GCC environment.

We implemented the network handler in minithread.c. We also implemented
functions for unreliable datagram in minimsg.c.

For some of the test cases to compile without warning, we modified their source
code.

network7_malpkgs.c tests by sending malformed packages with bad headers.

network8_bigpkgs.c tests by sending maximum and oversized packages.

network9_manypkgs.c tests by sending a large number (> 100000) of packages.
If choose to show progress, packages will be dropped because interrupts are
disabled during printf.
