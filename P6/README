CS4411 Project 6 - File System

The project is done in GNU/Linux environment.

Each 4kb block can hold 32 inodes.

Each inode can have 11 direct, 1 single indirect, 1 double indirect and 1
triple indirect pointers. 
There may still be issues in indirect block management.

A block cache is used for read/write operations. To preserve file system
integrity, all read/write are blocking.

Bitmaps are used to mark free inodes and blocks.

Usage:
1. make - Generates three targets: minithread, mkfs and fsck.
2. ./mkfs <number of 4kb blocks> - Make virtual file system in file 'minidisk'.
3. ./minithread - Run program.

By default in 'disk.c', 'use_existing_disk' is set to 1, and 'disk_name' is
set to 'minidisk'.

./fsck can be used to check the integrity of the file system.
